To build a CPA archive from the data, use the scripts located in
Nooskewl_Engine/tools/cpa. For example:

$ cd monster-rpg-3-data
$ ../Nooskewl_Engine/tools/cpa/mkcpa.sh ../MonsterRPG3.cpa

This will create MonsterRPG3.cpa and MonsterRPG3.cpa.uncompressed up one
directory from monster-rpg-3-data. The uncompressed version will be used on
some platforms but isn't required yet, so you can delete it.
